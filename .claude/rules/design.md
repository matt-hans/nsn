## Design Philosophy Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Solutions must be straightforward and easy to understand.
- Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary abstraction.
- Prioritise code readability and maintainability.

### YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)

- Do not add speculative features or future-proofing unless explicitly required.
- Focus only on immediate requirements and deliverables.
- Minimise code bloat and long-term technical debt.

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle** — each module or function should do one thing only.
- **Open-Closed Principle** — software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** — derived classes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **Interface Segregation Principle** — prefer many specific interfaces over one general-purpose interface.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** — depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
