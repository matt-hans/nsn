## Code Quality Standards

- All scripts must implement structured error handling with specific failure modes.
- Every function must include a concise, purpose-driven docstring.
- Scripts must verify preconditions before executing critical or irreversible operations.
- Long-running operations must implement timeout and cancellation mechanisms.
- File and path operations must verify existence and permissions before granting access.
