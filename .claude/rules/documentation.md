## Documentation Protocols

- Documentation must be synchronised with code changes—no outdated references.
- Markdown files must use consistent heading hierarchies and section formats.
- Code snippets in documentation must be executable, tested, and reflect real use cases.
- Each doc must clearly outline: purpose, usage, parameters, and examples.
- Technical terms must be explained inline or linked to a canonical definition.
