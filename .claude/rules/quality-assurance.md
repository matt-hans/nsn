## Quality Assurance Procedures

- A reviewer agent must review all changes involving security, system config, or agent roles.
- Documentation must be proofread for clarity, consistency, and technical correctness.
- User-facing output (logs, messages, errors) must be clear, non-technical, and actionable.
- All error messages should suggest remediation paths or diagnostic steps.
- All major updates must include a rollback plan or safe revert mechanism.
