## Process Execution Requirements

- Agents must log all actions with appropriate severity (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.).
- Any failed task must include a clear, human-readable error report.
- Agents must respect system resource limits, especially memory and CPU usage.
- Long-running tasks must expose progress indicators or checkpoints.
- Retry logic must include exponential backoff and failure limits.
