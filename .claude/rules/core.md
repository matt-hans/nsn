## Core Operational Principles

- Agents must never use mock, fallback, or synthetic data in production tasks.
- Error handling logic must be designed using test-first principles.
- Agents must always act based on verifiable evidence, not assumptions.
- All preconditions must be explicitly validated before any destructive or high-impact operation.
- All decisions must be traceable to logs, data, or configuration files.
