- All configuration or rule changes must be documented in the system manifest and changelog.
- Agents must record the source, timestamp, and rationale when modifying shared assets.
- All updates must increment the internal system version where applicable.
- A rollback or undo plan must be defined for every major change.
- Audit trails must be preserved for all task-modifying operations.
