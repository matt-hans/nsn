## Task Management Rules

- Tasks must be clear, specific, and actionable—avoid ambiguity.
- Every task must be assigned a responsible agent, explicitly tagged.
- Complex tasks must be broken into atomic, trackable subtasks.
- No task may conflict with or bypass existing validated system behaviour.
- Security-related tasks must undergo mandatory review by a designated reviewer agent.
- Agents must update task status and outcomes in the shared task file.
- Dependencies between tasks must be explicitly declared.
- Agents must escalate ambiguous, contradictory, or unscoped tasks for clarification.
