# Voice Profiles for Bark TTS
#
# This configuration maps character voice IDs to Bark speaker presets
# and optional reference audio for zero-shot cloning.
#
# Types:
#   - preset: Uses built-in Bark speaker (no reference audio needed)
#   - cloned: Uses reference audio to clone voice (requires .wav file)
#
# Bark speaker presets (v2/en_speaker_N where N=0-9):
#   0: Neutral male narrator
#   1: Calm female
#   2: Energetic male
#   3: Soft female
#   4: Deep male
#   5: Young female
#   6: Gruff/raspy male (good for "Rick" style)
#   7: Warm female
#   8: Fast-talking male
#   9: Higher-pitched male (good for "Morty" style)
