# ICN Voice ID to Kokoro Voice ID Mapping
#
# This configuration maps ICN character voice IDs (used in Recipes) to
# actual Kokoro-82M voice IDs available in the model.
#
# Format:
#   icn_voice_id: kokoro_voice_id
#
# Available Kokoro voices (as of v0.19):
# - am_adam, am_michael, bf_emma, bf_isabella, bm_george, bm_lewis
# - af_sarah, af_jessica, af_nicole, af_heart
# - And many more across 8 languages (54 total voices)
#
# Voice Selection Strategy:
# - rick_c137: Deep, raspy male voice → am_adam (American male, authoritative)
# - morty: Higher-pitched, anxious male voice → bf_emma (British female, younger timbre)
# - summer: Female voice, confident → af_jessica (American female, assertive)
#
# Note: Kokoro v0.19 supports voice blending using "+" syntax:
#   - Equal blend: "af_sarah+af_jessica"
#   - Weighted blend: "af_sarah(0.3)+af_jessica(0.7)"
#
# For ICN MVP, we use single voices for simplicity. Voice blending can be
# added in future iterations for more nuanced character voices.

# Main character voices (minimum 3 for acceptance criteria)
rick_c137: af_sky      # Deep, authoritative male voice
morty: af_bella        # Higher-pitched, anxious voice (using female voice for pitch)
summer: af_jessica     # Confident female voice

# Additional character voices (optional, for future expansion)
jerry: am_michael      # Hesitant, average male voice
beth: af_sarah         # Mature, professional female voice
mr_meeseeks: bf_emma   # Higher energy, helping voice

# Fallback/default voice
