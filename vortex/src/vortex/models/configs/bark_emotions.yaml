# Bark TTS Emotion Configuration
#
# Bark doesn't have explicit emotion controls like Kokoro's speed parameter.
# Instead, we control emotion through:
#   1. Temperature settings (coarse_temp, fine_temp)
#   2. Optional text prefixes (experimental, may or may not influence output)
#
# Temperature Guide:
#   - coarse_temp: Controls prosody/rhythm variation (0.0-1.0)
#     Lower = more monotone, Higher = more varied intonation
#   - fine_temp: Controls acoustic detail variation (0.0-1.0)
#     Lower = cleaner audio, Higher = more artifacts/texture
#
# For "Interdimensional Cable" aesthetic:
#   - Higher coarse_temp = more chaotic prosody (good)
#   - Moderate fine_temp = some texture without too much hiss
