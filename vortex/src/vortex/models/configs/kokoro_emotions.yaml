# Emotion Parameter Mappings for Kokoro TTS
#
# This configuration defines how emotional states map to synthesis parameters.
# Emotions affect speech characteristics like pitch, tempo, and energy.
#
# Format:
#   emotion_name:
#     pitch_shift: <Hz shift, positive = higher pitch, negative = lower>
#     tempo: <speed multiplier, 1.0 = normal>
#     energy: <amplitude/emphasis, 1.0 = normal>
#
# Parameter Ranges:
# - pitch_shift: -100 to +150 Hz (human speech range ~80-260 Hz)
# - tempo: 0.8 to 1.3 (slower to faster)
# - energy: 0.5 to 1.5 (quieter to louder/more emphatic)
#
# Note: Kokoro may not natively support all parameters. Currently, tempo is
# directly supported via speed parameter. Pitch shifting and energy modulation
# may require post-processing (future enhancement).

# Core emotions (required by acceptance criteria)

neutral:
  pitch_shift: 0        # No pitch change
  tempo: 1.0            # Normal speed
  energy: 1.0           # Normal amplitude
  description: "Flat, emotionless delivery"

excited:
  pitch_shift: 50       # Slightly higher pitch
  tempo: 1.15           # Faster speech (15% increase)
  energy: 1.3           # More emphasis
  description: "Enthusiastic, upbeat, higher energy"

sad:
  pitch_shift: -30      # Lower pitch
  tempo: 0.9            # Slower speech (10% decrease)
  energy: 0.7           # Quieter, less emphatic
  description: "Melancholic, subdued, lower energy"

angry:
  pitch_shift: 20       # Slightly higher pitch
  tempo: 1.1            # Faster speech (10% increase)
  energy: 1.4           # Strong emphasis
  description: "Aggressive, forceful, intense"

manic:
  pitch_shift: 100      # Much higher pitch
  tempo: 1.25           # Very fast speech (25% increase)
  energy: 1.5           # Maximum emphasis
  description: "Frenzied, erratic, hyperactive (Rick's signature emotion)"

# Additional emotions (optional, for future expansion)

calm:
  pitch_shift: -10      # Slightly lower pitch
  tempo: 0.95           # Slightly slower
  energy: 0.9           # Relaxed amplitude
  description: "Soothing, peaceful, composed"

sarcastic:
  pitch_shift: 30       # Exaggerated pitch variance
  tempo: 1.05           # Slightly faster
  energy: 1.2           # Emphasized delivery
  description: "Ironic, mocking, exaggerated intonation"

fearful:
  pitch_shift: 60       # Higher pitch (stress response)
  tempo: 1.2            # Faster (anxious)
  energy: 1.1           # Tense
  description: "Anxious, nervous, stressed"

# Implementation Notes:
# 1. Tempo is directly applied via Kokoro's speed parameter
# 2. Pitch_shift and energy require post-processing or voice blending
# 3. For MVP, tempo is the primary emotion control
# 4. Future: Implement pitch shifting using librosa or torch audio transforms
# 5. Future: Energy can be applied via amplitude envelope modulation
