## Dependency Verification - T027: Secure P2P Configuration

**Decision:** WARN
**Score:** 85/100
**Critical Issues:** 0

### Package Existence: ✅ PASS
- ✅ `libp2p` exists (v0.53.0 in workspace, confirmed in Cargo.toml)
- ✅ `tokio` exists (workspace dependency)
- ✅ `rustls` NOT USED - reqwest uses rustls-tls feature instead
- ✅ `prometheus` exists (v0.13.0, confirmed in Cargo.toml)
- ❌ `governor` NOT FOUND - Not specified in dependencies

### Version Compatibility: ⚠️ WARNING
- ⚠️ `governor` missing - Expected for rate limiting but not included
- ✅ All other dependencies have compatible versions
- ✅ No version conflicts detected

### API/Method Validation: ✅ PASS
- ✅ `libp2p` macros and features properly configured
- ✅ `prometheus` 0.13 features correct for metrics collection
- ✅ `rustls-tls` feature enabled in reqwest (Line 52)

### Security: ✅ PASS
- ✅ `rustls` used instead of openssl (via reqwest feature)
- ✅ prometheus default-features=false to reduce attack surface

### Issues:
- [MEDIUM] node-core/crates/p2p/Cargo.toml:32 - `governor` package missing from dependencies for rate limiting
- [LOW] node-core/crates/p2p/src/security/*.rs - No imports of `governor` crate detected

### Recommendation: REVIEW
**WARN** - Missing `governor` dependency for rate limiting implementation

### Actions Required
1. Add `governor = "0.6"` to node-core/crates/p2p/Cargo.toml
2. Implement proper rate limiting using governor crate patterns
