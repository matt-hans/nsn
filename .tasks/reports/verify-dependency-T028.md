| nvidia-smi | ✅ PASS | Part of NVIDIA driver package |

## Issues Found

1. **[MEDIUM] kokoro>=0.7.0** - Package kokoro may not exist on PyPI. This appears to be a custom or private package. The dependency should be either:
   - Hosted in a private repository
   - Installed from a local wheel
   - Documentation should clarify the source

## Recommendations

1. ** kokoro package:** Verify the package source. If it's a custom package, ensure it's built and available to the Docker build process.

2. **Add kokoro to Docker build:** If kokoro is not available on PyPI, it should be installed during the Docker build process from a local wheel or source.

3. **Verify model URLs:** Ensure all Hugging Face model URLs in download-models.py are accessible and have the correct file names.

## Security Notes

- All images are from official sources (Docker Hub)
- No obvious security vulnerabilities detected
- CUDA runtime image is appropriate for GPU workloads
- Coturn versions are current and well-maintained

## Conclusion

The T028 task dependencies are mostly verified and appear legitimate. The only concern is the kokoro Python package, which needs clarification on its source. All Docker images are available and versions are appropriately specified.
