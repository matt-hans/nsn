Decision: PASS
Score: 95/100
Critical Issues: 0
Issues:
- [MEDIUM] scoring.rs:110 - build_peer_score_params() exceeds 100 LOC (110 LOC)

Checklist:
✅ Check for monster files (>1000 LOC)
✅ Check cyclomatic complexity (>15)
✅ Check for god classes
✅ Verify function lengths are reasonable

Recommendation: PASS
Rationale: All critical thresholds passed. One function exceeds recommended length but within acceptable limits for configuration logic.
