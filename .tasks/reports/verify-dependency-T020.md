### Local Module Dependencies

| Module | Import Path | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| `vortex.models.clip_ensemble` | `from vortex.models.clip_ensemble import DualClipResult` | ✅ PASS | Local module, verified in vortex/ directory |
| `vortex.orchestration.models` | `from vortex.orchestration.models import ...` | ✅ PASS | Local package import |

## Detailed Analysis

### Package Existence Check
- ✅ `asyncio` - Standard library, no registry needed
- ✅ `torch` - Verified on PyPI, version 2.1+ matches ICN requirements
- ✅ `dataclasses` - Standard library (Python 3.7+)
- ✅ `logging` - Standard library
- ✅ `time` - Standard library
- ✅ `typing` - Standard library

### Version Compatibility
- ✅ All standard library packages are inherently compatible
- ✅ `torch` requirement (≥2.1) matches ICN technical specifications
- ✅ No version conflicts detected

### Typosquatting Detection
- ✅ No suspicious package names detected
- ✅ All imports match standard library or verified local modules

### Import Validation
```python
# Validated imports:
import asyncio        # Standard asyncio for async operations
import logging        # Standard logging for observability
import time           # Standard time for monotonic clocks
from typing import Any  # Standard type hints
import torch           # Verified PyTorch dependency
from dataclasses import dataclass  # Standard dataclass decorator
```

### Risk Assessment
- **Security Risk**: LOW - All dependencies are either standard library or verified PyPI packages
- **Compatibility Risk**: NONE - No version conflicts or dependency mismatches
- **Supply Chain Risk**: LOW - `torch` is well-established with minimal risk

## Code Quality Assessment

### Error Handling
- ✅ Implements proper exception handling for async operations
- ✅ Uses specific exception types (`DeadlineMissError`, `RuntimeError`)
- ✅ Includes comprehensive error logging

### Resource Management
- ✅ Uses `time.monotonic()` for accurate timing
- ✅ Implements deadline tracking to prevent wasted computation
- ✅ Proper timeout enforcement per generation stage

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Parallel execution of audio + image generation
- ✅ Predictive deadline abort to prevent doomed work
- ✅ Exponential backoff for transient failures

## Compliance Verification

### ICN Technical Specifications
- ✅ Compatible with PyTorch 2.1+ requirement
- ✅ Meets asyncio integration requirements
- ✅ Follows ICN coding standards (structured error handling, docstrings)

### Documentation Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
- ✅ Clear example usage provided
- ✅ Parameters, returns, and exceptions documented

## Conclusion

All dependencies for Task T020 (Slot Timing Orchestration) have been verified and approved. The implementation uses only standard Python libraries and verified PyTorch packages, with no security concerns or version conflicts detected. The code follows ICN technical specifications and implements robust error handling and performance optimizations.

**Recommendation: APPROVE for implementation**
