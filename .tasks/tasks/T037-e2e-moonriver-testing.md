## Description

Execute comprehensive end-to-end testing on Moonriver testnet with 10+ participant nodes simulating the full ICN protocol: stake ICN tokens → elect directors → generate AI video via Vortex → achieve BFT consensus → distribute video via P2P → update reputation → handle challenges/disputes. Validates entire system under real-world network conditions before mainnet launch.

**Test Objectives:**
1. Verify runtime upgrade deployed successfully to Moonriver
2. Simulate 10+ nodes (3 Directors, 3 Super-Nodes, 4 Viewers)
3. Complete 10+ slot generations end-to-end
4. Test challenge/dispute mechanism with intentional fraud
5. Verify P2P video distribution to all viewers
6. Measure glass-to-glass latency (<45s target)
7. Load test BFT coordination (target: 50 TPS on-chain events)

**Success Criteria (from PRD):**
- All pallets operational on Moonriver
- 10+ test nodes participating
- Complete staking → election → reputation → BFT flow
- Video distribution working

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Moonriver runtime upgrade proposal submitted and enacted
- [ ] 10+ test accounts funded with DEV tokens (Moonriver testnet)
- [ ] 3 Director nodes running with GPU (RTX 3060+)
- [ ] 3 Super-Node instances deployed (erasure storage configured)
- [ ] 4 Viewer nodes connected to P2P mesh
- [ ] 10+ successful slot generations completed
- [ ] All generated videos verified via CLIP (score >0.75)
- [ ] BFT consensus reached in ≥8/10 slots
- [ ] At least 1 challenge successfully resolved (fraud detected and slashed)
- [ ] Video distributed to all viewers within 30s of generation
- [ ] Glass-to-glass latency measured: average <45s, P99 <60s
- [ ] Reputation scores updated correctly for all participants
- [ ] No critical errors in logs (panic, segfault, OOM)
- [ ] TPS load test: 50 on-chain events/second sustained for 5 minutes
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collected for all nodes
- [ ] Test report generated with performance data

## Test Scenarios

**Test Case 1: Runtime Deployment and Initialization**
- Given: Moonriver testnet access, runtime WASM built
- When: Submit `sudo.sudoUncheckedWeight(system.setCode)` extrinsic
- Then: Runtime upgrade succeeds, all pallets callable, no storage migration errors

**Test Case 2: Multi-Account Staking**
- Given: 10 test accounts with 1000 DEV each
- When: Each account stakes 100-500 ICN with different roles (Director/SuperNode/Validator)
- Then: Stakes recorded on-chain, roles assigned correctly, regional distribution enforced

**Test Case 3: Director Election and Cooldown**
- Given: 5 Directors staked across 3 regions
- When: Advance to slot 100
- Then: Exactly 5 directors elected, no more than 2 from same region, cooldown prevents re-election for 20 slots

**Test Case 4: Full Slot Generation**
- Given: 5 Directors elected for slot 200
- When: Recipe published to GossipSub topic `/icn/recipes/1.0.0`
- Then:
  1. All 5 Directors receive recipe within 2s
  2. Vortex generates video in <15s
  3. CLIP verification scores >0.75 for all
  4. BFT coordination via gRPC completes in <10s
  5. 3+ Directors agree on canonical embedding hash
  6. Canonical Director submits BFT result to Moonriver
  7. Super-Nodes download video chunks within 5s
  8. Viewers receive video within 30s

**Test Case 5: BFT Challenge (Fraud Detection)**
- Given: Slot 250 completed with BFT result
- When: Challenger detects fraudulent result (CLIP score <0.60), submits challenge with 25 ICN bond
- Then:
  1. Challenge recorded on-chain with 50-block deadline
  2. Validators provide attestations
  3. Challenge upheld (majority validators disagree with result)
  4. Directors slashed 100 ICN each
  5. Challenger refunded 25 ICN + 10 ICN reward
  6. Reputation updated (-200 for directors, +50 for challenger)

**Test Case 6: Video Distribution Hierarchy**
- Given: Canonical video generated by Director
- When: Video published to P2P network
- Then:
  1. Super-Nodes (Tier 1) download within 5s
  2. Regional Relays (Tier 2) download from Super-Nodes within 10s
  3. Viewers (Tier 3) download from Relays within 20s
  4. Total propagation time <30s

**Test Case 7: Reputation Decay and Updates**
- Given: Directors and Validators with reputation scores >500
- When: 2 weeks pass with no activity
- Then: Reputation decays 10% per week (compounding), on-chain storage reflects updated scores

**Test Case 8: Load Test - 50 TPS**
- Given: 10+ nodes active
- When: Submit 50 reputation events/second for 5 minutes (15,000 total events)
- Then: All events processed, Moonriver handles load, block times stable (~6s), no timeouts

**Test Case 9: NAT Traversal (Real Network Conditions)**
- Given: Viewers behind NAT (home routers)
- When: Viewers attempt P2P connections
- Then: STUN → UPnP → Circuit Relay fallback succeeds, all viewers connected

**Test Case 10: Graceful Degradation (Node Failure)**
- Given: 5 Directors elected, 1 Director node crashes
- When: BFT coordination continues with 4 remaining Directors
- Then: Consensus reached with 3-of-4 agreement, system continues operating

## Dependencies

**Hard Dependencies:**
- [T001] Moonbeam Fork Setup
- [T002-T007] All pallets implemented
- [T009-T011] Off-chain node implementations
- [T028] Local dev environment (for testing scripts)
- [T029] Director Docker image
- [T035] Integration tests (validates components work)

**External Dependencies:**
- Moonriver testnet access
- DEV tokens for testing (faucet)
- Cloud VMs for 10+ nodes (or community volunteers)
- 3 GPUs (RTX 3060+) for Directors

## Design Decisions

**Decision 1: 10 Nodes vs. 50 Nodes for Initial Test**
- **Rationale:** 10 nodes sufficient to validate protocol, easier to coordinate, lower cost
- **Trade-offs:** (+) Manageable, cost-effective. (-) Doesn't test full-scale network

**Decision 2: Moonriver vs. Local Testnet**
- **Rationale:** Moonriver provides real network conditions (latency, censorship, NAT)
- **Trade-offs:** (+) Realistic. (-) Higher costs, slower iteration

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Runtime upgrade rejected by governance | High | Low | Engage Moonriver community early, provide clear rationale |
| Insufficient GPU capacity | High | Medium | Use cloud GPU instances (AWS g4dn, GCP A10) |
| Network partitions during testing | Medium | Medium | Test with 3 geographically distributed nodes |
| BFT fails to reach consensus | High | Low | Extensive local testing first (T035), fallback to 2-of-5 threshold |
